  author   = "Salway, Ruth and Wakefield, Jon",
  abstract = "This article considers the modeling of single-dose
              pharmacokinetic data. Traditionally, so-called compartmental
              models have been used to analyze such data. Unfortunately, the
              mean function of such models are sums of exponentials for which
              inference and computation may not be straightforward. We present
              an alternative to these models based on generalized linear
              models, for which desirable statistical properties exist, with a
              logarithmic link and gamma distribution. The latter has a
              constant coefficient of variation, which is often appropriate for
              pharmacokinetic data. Inference is convenient from either a
              likelihood or a Bayesian perspective. We consider models for both
              single and multiple individuals, the latter via generalized
              linear mixed models. For single individuals, Bayesian computation
              may be carried out with recourse to simulation. We describe a
              rejection algorithm that, unlike Markov chain Monte Carlo,
              produces independent samples from the posterior and allows
              straightforward calculation of Bayes factors for model
              comparison. We also illustrate how prior distributions may be
              specified in terms of model-free pharmacokinetic parameters of
              interest. The methods are applied to data from 12 individuals
              following administration of the antiasthmatic agent theophylline.",

              pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and use of Maximum A Posteriori
              (MAP) Bayesian estimation to predict tacrolimus exposure and
              subsequent drug dosage requirements in solid organ transplant
              recipients. A literature search was conducted which identified 56
              studies that assessed the population pharmacokinetics of
              tacrolimus based on non-linear mixed effects modelling and 14
              studies that assessed the predictive performance of MAP Bayesian
              estimation of tacrolimus area under the plasma concentration-time
              curve (AUC) from time zero to the end of the dosing interval.
              Studies were most commonly undertaken in adult kidney transplant
              recipients and investigated the immediate-release formulation.
              The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus were described using one- and
              two-compartment disposition models with first-order elimination
              in 61 and 39 \% of population pharmacokinetic studies,
              respectively. Variability in tacrolimus whole blood apparent
              clearance amongst transplant recipients was most commonly related
              to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 genotype (rs776746), patient
              haematocrit, patient weight, post-operative day and hepatic
              function (aspartate aminotransferase). Bias, as calculated using
              estimation of the mean predictive error (MPE) or mean percentage
              predictive error (MPPE) associated with prediction of the
              tacrolimus AUC, ranged from -15 to 9.95 \%. Imprecision, as
              calculated through estimation of the root mean squared error
              (RMSE) or mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), was generally
              much poorer overall, ranging from 0.81 to 40. r values ranged
              from 0.27 to 0.99 \%. Of the Bayesian forecasting strategies that
              used two or more tacrolimus concentrations, 71 \% showed bias of
              10 \% or less; however, only 39 \% showed imprecision of 10 \% or
              less. The combination of sampling times at 0, 1 and 3 h post-dose
              consistently showed bias and imprecision values of less than 15
              \%. No studies to date have examined how closely MAP Bayesian
              dosage predictions of tacrolimus actually achieve target AUC by
              comparing dosage prediction from one occasion with a future
              measured AUC. Further research involving larger prospective
              studies including more diverse transplant groups and the
              extended-release formulation of tacrolimus is needed. Several
              questions require further examination, including the following.
              Do Bayesian forecasting methods currently use the most
              appropriate population pharmacokinetic models and optimal
              sampling times for dosage prediction? Does Bayesian forecasting
              perform well when applied to make dosage predictions on a
              subsequent occasion? How can Bayesian forecasting be simplified
              for use in the clinical setting? And, are patient outcomes
              improved with dosage prediction based on Bayesian forecasting
              compared with trough concentration monitoring?",

              Bayesian estimation for a five-probe phenotyping cocktail",
  author   = "Nguyen, Thu Thuy and B{\'e}nech, Henri and Pruvost, Alain and
              Lenuzza, Natacha",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: Cocktail approach using a combination of probes to
              phenotype several cytochromes P450 or transporters is of high
              interest in anticipating drug--drug interactions and personalized
              medicine. Its clinical use remains however limited by the
              intensive sampling scheme required to obtain phenotyping indexes
              (PI) which consists in calculating the area under the
              concentration--time curves. We proposed to use maximum a
              posteriori Bayesian estimation (MAPBE) that incorporates
              available information from the whole population to derive PI from
              a few individual observations. The performance of a limited
              sampling strategy (LSS) based on MAPBE was evaluated for a
              five-probe cocktail. METHODS: The studied cocktail included
              midazolam, tolbutamide, caffeine, dextromethorphan, omeprazole
              and their relevant metabolites. Prior information for MAPBE was
              obtained by nonlinear mixed-effect modelling of data from a pilot
              study. Sampling times were chosen based on optimal design theory
              using the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Through a
              simulation study, we investigated the predicted PI in terms of
              bias and imprecision for varying number and timing of samples.
              RESULTS: Some three-point Bayesian designs gave mean prediction
              errors in [−5 \%, 5 \%], root mean square errors below 30 \% for
              all probes, except dextromethorphan whose model should be
              consolidated further with additional data. This approach gave
              overall less outlier predicted values than single-point metrics
              and was more flexible to the timing of the latest sampling.
              CONCLUSIONS: MAPBE is accurate for predicting simultaneously
              several PI while being flexible in terms of integrating clinical
              constraints. Therefore, LSS based on MAPBE could help reduce the
              time of presence in hospital for individuals to be phenotyped.",

              used to prevent thromboses that may arise as a consequence of
              orthopedic and vascular surgery or underlying cardiovascular
              disease. Warfarin is associated with a notoriously narrow
              therapeutic window where small variations in dosing may result in
              hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. To ultimately improve
              dosing of warfarin, we evaluated models for stable maintenance
              dose that incorporated both clinical and genetic factors. METHOD:
              A model was constructed by evaluating the contribution to dosing
              variability of the following clinical factors: age, gender, body
              surface area, and presence or absence of prosthetic heart valves
              or diabetes. The model was then sequentially expanded by
              incorporating polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9; vitamin
              K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1); gamma
              carboxylase; factor VII; and apolipoprotein (Apo) E genes.
              RESULTS: Of genetic factors evaluated in the model, CYP2C9 and
              VKORC1 each contributed substantially to dose variability, and
              together with clinical factors explained 56\% of the individual
              variability in stable warfarin dose. In contrast, gamma
              carboxylase, factor VII and Apo E polymorphisms contributed
              little to dose variability. CONCLUSION: The importance of CYP2C9
              and VKORC1 to patient-specific dose of warfarin has been
              confirmed, while polymorphisms of gamma carboxylase, factor VII
              and Apo E genes did not substantially contribute to predictive

              reduction of stroke risk in non-valvular atrial fibrillation,
              thromboprophylaxis following hip or knee replacement surgery, the
              treatment of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and
              prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
              embolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of apixaban is ~
              50\%. Food does not have a clinically meaningful impact on the
              bioavailability. Apixaban exposure increases dose proportionally
              for oral doses up to 10 mg. Apixaban is rapidly absorbed, with
              maximum concentration occurring 3-4 h after oral administration,
              and has a half-life of approximately 12 h. Elimination occurs via
              multiple pathways including metabolism, biliary excretion, and
              direct intestinal excretion, with approximately 27\% of total
              apixaban clearance occurring via renal excretion. The
              pharmacokinetics of apixaban are consistent across a broad range
              of patients, and apixaban has limited clinically relevant
              interactions with most commonly prescribed medications, allowing

              LSS's (maximally three sampling time points) were developed for
              Tac QD from full 24-h sampling by LRA in 27 Caucasian, stable

              absolute prediction error < 10\%) and precision (root mean

              in two independent groups (early and late post-transplant, n = 12
              each). RESULTS: LRA determined a single 8 hours post-dose
              measurement (C) to fulfil predefined criteria for accuracy (MAPE

              include C for any LSS, unless it was forced into the model. MAPB
              estimation showed similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: In renal
              transplant patients, sampling in the elimination phase (C)
              accurately predicted Tac QD exposure, contrary to C. The 3-point
              sampling C C and C had the best performance and is also valid
              early post-transplant. These LSS's were similarly predictive with
              MAPB estimation. Dried blood spot could facilitate late sampling
              in clinical practice.",

              over-dose in patients at doses lower than 2 mg/kg, and only 50\%
              of individual variability in daily stable doses can be explained.
              In this study, we developed a novel population pharmacokinetic
              (PK) model based on a warfarin dose algorithm for Han Chinese
              patients with valve replacement for improving the dose prediction
              accuracy, especially in patients with low doses. The individual
              pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter - apparent clearance of S- and
              R-warfarin (CLs) was obtained after establishing and validating
              the population PK model from 296 recruited patients with valve
              replacement. Then, the individual estimation of CLs, VKORC1
              genotypes, the steady-state international normalized ratio (INR)
              values and age were used to describe the maintenance doses by
              multiple linear regression for 144 steady-state patients. The
              newly established dosing algorithm was then validated in an
              independent group of 42 patients and was compared with other
              dosing algorithms for the accuracy and precision of prediction.
              The final regression model developed was as follows:
              Dose=-0.023$\times$AGE+1.834$\times$VKORC1+0.952$\times$INR+2.156$\times$CLs
              (the target INR value ranges from 1.8 to 2.5). The validation of
              the algorithm in another group of 42 patients showed that the
              individual variation rate (71.6\%) was higher than in the
              gene-guided dosing models. The over-estimation rate in patients
              with low doses (<2 mg/kg) was lower than the other dosing
              methods. This novel dosing algorithm based on a population PK
              model improves the predictive performance of the maintenance dose
              of warfarin, especially for low dose (<2 mg/d) patients.",

  abstract = "With increasing the application of decision support systems in
              various fields, using such systems in different aspects of
              medical science has been growing. Drug's dose prediction is one
              of the most important issues which can be improved using decision
              support systems. In this paper, a new multi-objective feature
              approach has been proposed to support warfarin dose prediction
              decision. Warfarin is an anticoagulant normally used in the
              prevention of the formation of clots. This research was conducted
              on 553 patients during 2013-2015 who were candidates for using
              warfarin and their INR was in the target range. Features
              affecting dose was implemented and evaluated, which were clinical
              and genetic characteristics extracted, and new methods of feature
              selection based on multi-objective optimization methods such as
              the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and
              Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) along with
              the evaluation of artificial neural networks were used.
              Multi-objective optimization methods have more accuracy and
              performance compared to the classic methods of feature selection.
              Furthermore, multi-objective particle swarm optimization
              algorithm has higher precision than Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
              Algorithm-II. With a choice of seven features Mean Square Error
              (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error
              (MAE) were 0.011, 0.1 and 0.109 for MOPSO, respectively.",
